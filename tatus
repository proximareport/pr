    Fix Premium Feature popup ad conflicts and unlock ProxiHub features
    
    - Fixed Premium Feature popup z-index conflicts with ads on Mission Control page
    - Added z-50 classes to ensure popup appears above ads
    - Unlocked first tool per category on ProxiHub for free users
    - All other tools in each category remain locked behind tier 1+ subscription
    - Applied consistent access logic to both grouped and search views
    - Updated tool descriptions to clearly explain subscription requirements
